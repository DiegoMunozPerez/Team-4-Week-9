## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.

A multiPlexer is used to conveert 4-inputs and two switches allowing us to produce a single output / choose one output.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.

Demultiplexer allows us to take a two input and convert into a 4 outputs.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)

This circuit can be used to make a shannens expansion by converting a imput into either a zero or a one, reducing it into a shannons expantion. Can be used as functions for larger pojects.
